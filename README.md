# PRODIGY_CS_02: Image Encryption via Pixel Manipulation  
## Overview  
A Python tool to encrypt/decrypt images by inverting RGB pixel values. Built during my Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.  

## Features  
- Encrypt images by inverting RGB values.  
- Decrypt images by reapplying the same process.  
- Handles common image formats (PNG, JPG).
